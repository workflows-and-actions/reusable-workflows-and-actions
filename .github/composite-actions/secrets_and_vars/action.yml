name: Demo of using secrets and variables in a composite action
description: Uses secrets as input, unlike a reusable workflow where secrets are passed as secrets
inputs:
  repo_s:
    required: true  # if 'required' is 'false', set a default value using default: somevalue
    type: string
  org_s:
    required: true
    type: string
runs:
  using: "composite"
  steps:
    - name: print secrets that were passed as input
      shell: bash
      run: |
        echo ${{ inputs.repo_s }}
        echo ${{ inputs.org_s }}
    - name: print repo and org vars
      shell: bash
      run: |
        echo ${{ vars.repo_var }}
        echo ${{ vars.org_var }}
        echo done with action
